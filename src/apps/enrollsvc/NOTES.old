# Some summary notes about the enrollment service, a.k.a. "enrollsvc".
#
# This service consists of two sub-services; "mgmt" and "repl", which perform
# complementary functions but operate on common state (a directory bind-mounted
# into both containers);
#  * The common state consists of;
#    - the "enrollment database", currently implemented as a git repository.
#    - a "msgbus" directory, into which;
#      - the services write their stdout/stderr,
#      - control software outside the service containers can write commands to
#        be picked up by the services. Currently, this is limited to "stop"
#        functionality, which writes "die" to a file the service is
#        "tail_wait"ing, triggering it to exit.
#  * enrollsvc::mgmt provides the enrollment/registration functionality;
#    - The common state is mounted read-write.
#    - The enrollment interface is implemented as a flask app.
#      - API exposed at http[s]://<server>[:port]/v1/{add,query,delete,find}
#      - A human/interactive web UI lives at http[s]://<server>[:port]/
#    - Enrollment of a host+ek.pub 2-tuple triggers a (modular, configurable)
#      asset-generation process, to provision credentials and other host
#      secrets that are immediately sealed to the enrolled host's TPM and to a
#      recovery/break-glass credential before insertion into the database.
#    - The flask app runs as a non-root (flask_user) account in the container.
#    - The asset-generation and database-write processes run as a different,
#      non-root (db_user) account in the container.
#    - The flask app handlers invoke the asset-generation and querying
#      functions via constrained sudo rules, to prevent environment
#      contamination and limit information-passing to just the command
#      arguments.
#  * enrollsvc::repl provides a replication service to downstream attestation
#    service instances (attestsvc::repl).
#    - The common state is mounted read-only!
#    - The replication service uses "git-daemon" directly, running as a
#      non-root (db_user) account in the container.
#    - Use of the same db_user account (as used in the asset-generation
#      process) is to simplify file-system permissioning (user/group ownership
#      of database files).
#      - This does not leak any visibility to the asset-generation process in
#        the other container, only the database is present/shared/mounted in
#        both containers.
#      - The database (directory) is read-only at the mount level, so we don't
#        need account separation to protect the database from modification by
#        the replication functionality.
